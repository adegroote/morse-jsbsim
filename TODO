- There is some issue in the initialisation of the pose, which should explains
  most issue previously encountered such as :
	- wrong ECEF position
	- the magnetic field computation is not exactly the same for Morse and JSBSIM
  Understand the cause of it :)

- Add some way to launch a simulation more easily
- Find a way to define some kind of interfaces (magnetometer and
  Jsbsim_magnetometer has the same interface by 'accident')
